EmailFlow Project - Comprehensive Documentation

Executive Summary:
EmailFlow is an intelligent email triage and response automation system that leverages AI to categorize, prioritize, and generate responses for incoming emails. The system integrates with Gmail API to automatically fetch and process real emails, providing users with an efficient workflow for managing high volumes of email communications.

Key Features:

1. Gmail API Integration:
   - OAuth 2.0 authentication for secure Gmail access
   - Automatic email synchronization from user's Gmail account
   - Real-time fetching of emails with metadata preservation
   - Secure credential management

2. AI-Powered Email Processing:
   - Automatic classification of emails into categories (Support, Query, Request, Help)
   - Priority assessment (High, Medium, Low) based on content analysis
   - Sentiment analysis (Positive, Neutral, Negative)
   - Automated email summarization
   - Smart response generation using NVIDIA AI models

3. Natural Language Search:
   - Intuitive search using natural language queries
   - Semantic understanding of search intent
   - Multi-dimensional filtering (priority, sentiment, classification, sender)
   - Intelligent query interpretation

4. Response Management System:
   - AI-generated draft responses
   - Approval queue for reviewing responses before sending
   - Response tracking (pending, approved, sent, rejected)
   - Collaboration features for team-based email management

5. Analytics Dashboard:
   - Real-time statistics on email volume and distribution
   - Visual charts for priority, sentiment, and response status
   - Performance metrics and insights
   - Recent email activity overview

Technical Architecture:

Frontend:
- Flask-based web interface
- Responsive Bootstrap design
- Interactive charts using Chart.js
- Real-time updates and notifications

Backend:
- Python Flask framework
- MongoDB for data persistence
- RESTful API architecture
- Modular service-oriented design

AI Integration:
- NVIDIA NIM API for advanced language processing
- Sentence Transformers for local embedding generation
- Fallback mechanisms for offline functionality
- Configurable AI models and parameters

Gmail Integration:
- Google OAuth 2.0 flow implementation
- Secure token management
- Incremental email synchronization
- Error handling and retry mechanisms

Database Schema:
- Emails collection: Stores email content, metadata, classifications
- Responses collection: Tracks generated responses and their status
- Progress collection: Monitors long-running operations

Setup Instructions:

1. Environment Configuration:
   - Install Python 3.11+
   - Install dependencies from pyproject.toml
   - Set up MongoDB instance
   - Configure environment variables

2. Gmail API Setup:
   - Create Google Cloud Project
   - Enable Gmail API
   - Configure OAuth 2.0 Client ID with callback URL:
     http://localhost:5000/auth/google-callback
   - Update client credentials in gmail_service.py

3. NVIDIA API Configuration:
   - Obtain NVIDIA API key
   - Configure in environment variables or ai_service.py

4. Database Setup:
   - Ensure MongoDB is running
   - Configure connection string in .env file

Usage Workflow:

1. Authentication:
   - User connects Gmail account via OAuth
   - System securely stores credentials
   - Automatic email synchronization begins

2. Email Processing:
   - New emails are fetched from Gmail
   - AI analyzes and classifies each email
   - Results stored in database with metadata

3. Review and Response:
   - Users browse categorized emails in dashboard
   - AI generates suggested responses
   - Responses go through approval queue
   - Approved responses can be sent

4. Analytics and Search:
   - Dashboard provides insights on email trends
   - Natural language search enables intuitive querying
   - Filters allow precise email discovery

Security Considerations:
- OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication
- Token refresh mechanisms
- Data encryption in transit and at rest
- Session management and cleanup
- Input validation and sanitization

Scalability Features:
- Asynchronous processing capabilities
- Database indexing for performance
- Caching mechanisms
- Horizontal scaling support

Future Enhancements:
- Email sending capabilities
- Advanced collaboration features
- Mobile-responsive design
- Multi-language support
- Integration with other email providers
- Enhanced analytics and reporting

Troubleshooting:
- Common OAuth issues and resolutions
- Database connection problems
- AI service fallback mechanisms
- Performance optimization tips
